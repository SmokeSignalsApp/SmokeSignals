##### Genuinely Private Messaging
In the coming months we are launching a new approach to Private Instant Messaging where the strongest encryption ensures the highest possible level of privacy. This means messages you send can ONLY be read by the intended recipient(s) and never by a middleman.

#### Dissipating Messages
And because messages can be setup to dissipate and vanish completely from the internet, we are calling the app Smoke Signals. Messages can be configured to vanish just like smoke signals disappear into the air.

#### Anonymity
Signing up in the Smoke Signals app does not require a phone number or an email address.
