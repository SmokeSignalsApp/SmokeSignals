##### Genuinely Private Messaging
In the coming months we are launching a new approach to Private Instant Messaging where the strongest encryption ensures the highest possible level of privacy. This means messages you send can ONLY be read by the intended recipient(s) and never by a middleman.

#### Dissipating Messages
And because messages can be setup to dissipate and vanish completely from the internet, we are calling the app Smoke Signals. Messages can be configured to vanish just like smoke signals disappear into the air.

#### Anonymity
Signing up in the Smoke Signals app does not require a phone number or an email address.

#### No Centralized Server

Popular instant messaging apps use a centralized storage server to store your messages. However, bad actors can exploit this to spy on you or to sell your information. Smoke Signals' encryption makes this impossible and furthermore, there are no centralized storage servers. Instead we use decentralized relays.

#### Nostr Relays

Smoke Signal messages are sent using Nostr open source decentralized relays. Together with strong encryption this means your messages are not stored on a centralized server and can never be read by a middleman. You can also setup your own private relay for maximum safety. This is perfect for sovereign computing devices such as Umbrel or Start9.
